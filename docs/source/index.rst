About blogit:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Blogit is a Python3 static site generator. It uses the markdown2 parser,
and the Jinja2 template engine. It is a small code base, and does
gradual builds of your content. Thus it is quick! New posts are added by
demand, without the need to reparse and  rebuild all the content every
time.
